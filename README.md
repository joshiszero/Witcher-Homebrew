Witcher Swords
Steel for men: When wielding a Witcher’s sword made of steel (or other similar metals) and no other weapons, you gain +2 to damage rolls vs humanoids.
Silver for monsters: When wielding a Witcher’s sword made of silver and no other weapons, you gain +2 to damage rolls vs all non-humanoid creatures.
A Witcher’s sword is a specialized tool, forged to the highest of standards and enchanted with magical runes, it requires a specialist smith to forge a Witcher’s blade. As such, the time needed to craft, and the cost to buy a Witcher’s blade are considerably higher than their standard counterparts. The length of time and cost are at the DMs discretion.
The magical runes inscribed onto a Witcher’s sword can be used to attach a magical effect to the weapon.
Witcher’s swords share the same stats as a standard Longsword.
Additionally, switching between one-handed and two-handed on a Witcher sword requires no action or bonus action. (Discuss with Jamie about raising damage at levels.)

Witcher Medallion
(Discuss with Jamie)

Witcher Senses
You gain darkvision if your race did not already provide it, increase your movement speed by 5ft and gain can add twice your proficiency modifier to Insight, Investigation, Perception and Survival checks.

Witcher Potions
Starting from 2nd level you gain the ability to concoct Witcher Potions. These potions require materials gathered from monster corpses and can be crafted during a short rest. Due to the monstrous ingredients, Witcher’s potions are highly toxic and pose a high risk to non-Witchers.
Each potion a Witcher imbibes inflicts them with 1 point of toxicity (with the exception of the white honey potion). Whenever a Witcher gains a toxicity point past their toxicity limit they must make a con saving throw of 10, on a pass they gain the effect of the Witcher potion, on a fail they are poisoned for 1d6 turns per toxicity point over their max. When a Witcher exceeds or begins a round with a toxicity number equal to or greater than half their toxicity limit (rounded down) they must make a con saving throw of 10, on a pass they suffer no effects, on a save they suffer a point of exhaustion.
Non-Witchers who imbibe a Witcher potion must make a con saving throw of 10, on a pass they gain the basic effect of the potion, on a fail they are poisoned for 1d6 turns.
Your toxicity limit is listed on the class feature table. Toxicity points are lost after short or long rest, or after imbibing the white honey potion.
The list of Witcher potions available to concoct are detailed in the Witcher Potion list at the bottom of this guide.
The strength of your potions increases when you reach the 7th level in this class, when you reach the 12th level in this class, and again when you reach the 17th level in this class.

Signs    
Starting at 3rd you gain access to signs. Due to their magical resistances and mutations, Witcher’s are unable to harness the full power of magic. Signs are a simple magic spell that Witcher’s can cast using hand gestures, they require you to have at least one hand free to cast as well as having a somatic component.
Any time you make an attack action you may instead cast a Witcher Sign as an attack.
The list of Signs available to cast are detailed in the Signs list at the bottom of this guide.
The strength of your Signs increases when you reach the 8th level in this class, when you reach the 13th level in this class, and again when you reach the 18th level in this class.

Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
The number of attacks increases to three when you reach the 10th level.

Enhanced Witcher’s Sense
At 6th level, your Witcher’s senses improve. You gain the ability to peer at a creature and magically discern how best to hurt it. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. 
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

Witcher’s Prey
Starting at 6th level, you can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.
This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.

Master Witcher
Upon reaching the 20th level in this class you have achieved the rank of Master Witcher. The number of monsters you have faced during your adventure has left you unshakable, you gain immunity to the frightened condition.
